  "The provider registry and the desired-state validation it drives.

  Every provider the four provider slots can be pointed at is described once,
  in `providers`: the non-secret keys its templates interpolate, the
  credentials it needs, and which of those credentials OpenTofu reads from the
  process environment. Splitting that across separate tables is how a provider
  ends up validated against one set of keys and run with another — a stage
  exporting a credential nobody checked for, or a check demanding a key no
  stage ever uses."

  "Provider slot -> provider name -> what that choice implies.

  `:required` are non-secret keys desired state must supply, because a
  template interpolates them. `:secrets` are keys that must arrive through
  `GREEN_PAR_*` instead, and are never read from the file. `:tofu-env` is the
  subset of `:secrets` OpenTofu itself reads, mapped to the variable each
  provider looks for natively — passing them through the environment keeps
  them out of the rendered .tf files, which sit in the work directory in
  plaintext. A secret that is not in `:tofu-env` reaches its tool some other
  way: the SMTP passwords are looked up by Ansible at play time."
